# This project has taught me how to take a step back when I am obsessing on issues or features. If it's not productive work, take a break and look at it later.
# I tried to look at this project through a step by step process, adding features and methods as they made sense. 
# I think that I could use my knowledge of when to take a break and step back in many different sceniaros. This will help me refocus on what actually needs to get done.
# A new development stragety that I used was learning how to really modularize my code into smaller parts. I have never had to do it as much in any other assignments or projects. 
# I realized that once I was adding the same type of code in multiple different spots, it was time for me to iterate over smaller sections, using loops or different parameters.
# As the milestones went on, I was adding more and more functions or classes in order to keep up with the building requirnments. At one point I did a complete rewrite of my rendering and mesh loading because I knew what I was doing would not work long term.
# This class helped teach me what to do when I have been looking at the same code and bugs for to long. Taking a step back, or writing out what needs to happen on paper became a huge asset to me during this class. This applies to both my educational and professional pathways.
